/// @file  LoadBalancerS2.cpp
/// @brief The LoadBalancerS2 assigns work to the individual
///        threads in the computation of the special leaves in the
///        Lagarias-Miller-Odlyzko, Deleglise-Rivat and Gourdon
///        prime counting algorithms. This load balancer is used by
///        the S2_hard(x, y) and D(x, y) functions.
///
///        Simply parallelizing the computation of the special leaves
///        in the Lagarias-Miller-Odlyzko algorithm by subdividing
///        the sieve interval by the number of threads into equally
///        sized subintervals does not scale because the distribution
///        of the special leaves is highly skewed and most special
///        leaves are in the first few segments whereas later on
///        there are very few special leaves.
///
///        This LoadBalancerS2 therefore starts with a tiny segment
///        size of x^(1/4) and one segment per thread. Then the
///        LoadBalancerS2 gradually increases the segment size until
///        it reaches sqrt(limit). Afterwards the LoadBalancerS2
///        gradually increases the number of segments per thread as
///        long as the expected thread runtime is smaller than the
///        expected finish time of the algorithm. Near the end the
///        LoadBalancerS2 gradually decreases the number of segments
///        per thread in order to prevent 1 thread from running much
///        longer than all the other threads.
